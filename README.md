# Wrappers

This is basically like a .noderc that I like to have around with most of my web projects. I don't expect it to be terribly useful to anyone else, since the contents are simple and easy to re-implement. But I found myself re-writing a lot of stuff with every new package, so I thought I'd factor it out and re-use it as a package instead.
